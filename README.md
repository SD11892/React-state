# Will this React global state work in concurrent rendering?

Test tearing and branching in React concurrent rendering

- [Discussion in React 18 WG](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/116)

## Introduction

React 18 comes with a new feature called "concurrent rendering".
With global state, there's a theoretical issue called "tearing"
that might occur in React concurrent rendering.

Let's test the behavior!

## What is tearing?

  - https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/054b82781bec875345bd85a5b1344698

## What is branching?

- Old resources
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html

## How does it work?

A small app is implemented with each library.
The state has one count.
The app shows the count in fifty components.

There's a button outside of React and
if it's clicked it will trigger state mutation.
This is to emulate mutating an external state outside of React,
for example updating state by Redux middleware.

The render has intentionaly expensive computation.
If the mutation happens during rendering with in a tree,
there could be an inconsistency in the state.
If it finds the inconsistency, the test will fail.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dai-shi/will-this-react-global-state-work-in-concurrent-rendering.git
cd will-this-react-global-state-work-in-concurrent-rendering
yarn install
yarn run build-all
yarn run jest
```

To automatically run tests and update the README.md on OSX:
```
yarn jest:json
yarn jest:update
```

## Screencast (old one with react-redux v7. v8 works great.)

## Test scenario

- With useTransition
  - Level 1
    - 1: No tearing finally on update
    - 2: No tearing finally on mount
  - Level 2
    - 3: No tearing temporarily on update
    - 4: No tearing temporarily on mount
  - Level 3
    - 5: Can interrupt render (time slicing)
    - 6: Can branch state (wip state)
- With useDeferredValue
  - Level 1
    - 7: No tearing finally on update
    - 8: No tearing finally on mount
  - Level 2
    - 9: No tearing temporarily on update
    - 10: No tearing temporarily on mount

## Caveats

- Tearing and state branching may not be an issue depending on app requirements.
- The test is done in a very limited way.
  - Passing tests don't guarantee anything.
- The results may not be accurate.
  - Do not fully trust the results.

## If you are interested

The reason why I created this is to test my projects.

- [react-tracked](https://github.com/dai-shi/react-tracked)
- [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector)
- and so on

## Contributing

This repository is a tool for us to test some of global state libraries.
While it is totally fine to use the tool for other libraries under the license,
we don't generally accept adding a new library to the repository.

However, we are interested in various approaches.
If you have any suggestions feel free to open issues or pull requests.
We may consider adding (and removing) libraries.
Questions and discussions are also welcome in issues.

For listing global state libraries, we have another repository
https://github.com/dai-shi/lets-compare-global-state-with-react-hooks
in which we accept contributions. It's recommended to run this tool
and we put the result there, possibly a reference link to a PR
in this repository or a fork of this repository.
